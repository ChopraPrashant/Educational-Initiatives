# Mars Rover Simulation

This project simulates the movement of a Mars Rover on a grid-based terrain. The Rover can navigate the grid by moving forward, turning left, and turning right, while avoiding obstacles and staying within the grid boundaries. This simulation is built using Java with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and design patterns.

## Features

- Command Pattern: Encapsulates the movement and turning commands (M, L, R).
- Composite Pattern: Represents the grid and obstacles.
- Rover Movement: The rover can move forward, turn left, and turn right.
- Obstacle Detection: The rover avoids obstacles in its path.
- Status Report: Reports the rover's final position and direction after executing all commands.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or later installed on your system.

### Running the Simulation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mars-rover-simulation.git
